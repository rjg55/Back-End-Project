# FOR FUTURE DEVELOPERS

Please create two files in the main directory:

.env.test
.env.development

Within these files add PGDATABASE=nc_news_test (.env.test) and PGDATABASE=nc_news (.env.development)

Once finished, add these files to the .gitignore file

All done and you're ready to run locally!
