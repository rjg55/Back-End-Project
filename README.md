# FOR FUTURE DEVELOPERS

Please create two files in the main directory:

.env.test
.env.development

Within these files add PGDATABASE=<your_test_database_name_here> (.env.test) and PGDATABASE=<your_database_name_here> (.env.development)

Once finished, add these files to the .gitignore file

All done and you're ready to run locally!
